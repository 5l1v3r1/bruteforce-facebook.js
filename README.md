# bruteforce-facebook.js

## Usage

```
node bruteforce-facebook.js <target email> <dictionary file>
```

Does an online bruteforce attack of an account. If you're trying with completely random dictionaries (e.g. every possible combination of letters) the attack will not work. Facebook has its security measures. I believe you're allowed ~50 login attempts each day.


The script was developed and tested using Node.js v6.11.2.
